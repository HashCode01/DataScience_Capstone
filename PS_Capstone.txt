Nowadays, we frequently see the terms 'traveler for life', 'wanderlust', etc. and a lot of people wish to step out of their boundaries and go out exploring, learning new cultures, tasting different delicacies and connecting with various people around the globe. At the same time, it is not very easy to take time out of your tight schedule and plan trips to a place and prepare your travel itinerary for your travel. The itineraries available might not always match the constraints of the travelers and people often tend to miss some places on their tour.
As a part of my IBM Capstone Project, iI plan to come up with a itinerary planner for all the travelers out there based on the sightseeing locations and number of days. the This itinerary planner will try to cover as many tourist destinations as possible and and can also have special days for people who would like to take a day out for shopping or other relaxation activities. 
I plan to leverage the foursquare location data to get all the details of the tourist destinations in a certain city and then plan out the entire trip based on the number of days at hand and the maximum number of places a user would like to visit in a day.
The major stakeholders of this project are the tourists and travelers who wish to visit new places from time to time and wish to have planned itineraries before they start their trip. This project will help the users plan a proper trip and once they have their itineraries at hand, it's easy for them to book their rooms and hotels near these places and also can plan out their remaining time for other activities so that they can enjoy their vacation to the fullest!
